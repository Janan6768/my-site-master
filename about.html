            <p> My name is Janan, graduated (BScs) from Newports Institute of Communications and Economics, and looking for an
                internship to collect some experience for Frontend Development. I started loving coding and programming
                since I was 21 years old and since then I started learning frontend development. I am a science Student and an
                IT background, so, after completion of my higher secondary education I continued my learning and
                finally decided to pursue my career in this field.</p>

            <p> After frontend, the moment I realized its not as easy as i thought, but i
                convinced myself to learn more new things and technologies in order to make my skills way more efficient
                and increase creativity, as a beginner I believe that effort and practice are the most important things
                for me.</p>

            <p>Currently My aim is to become a successfull developer and help other peoples through my skills.</p>

            <p>
